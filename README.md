# Portfolio Site with Node.js, Express.js, and Pug

## Overview
The Portfolio Site is a web application designed to showcase the projects I've built during my Techdegree journey. This site features a modern landing page, an about page with contact information and an elevator pitch, and a series of project pages detailing at least my first five projects from the Techdegree.

The site uses a JSON file to store all the data about the projects. Pug templates are used to generate the markup displayed in the browser, and Node.js with Express.js is used to handle server-side operations.
